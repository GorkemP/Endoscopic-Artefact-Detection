## Implementation of the framework proposed for the Endoscopic Artefact Detection and Segmentation (EAD2020) Challenge - Detection Task

Challenge: https://ead2020.grand-challenge.org/Home/

Our method ranked first in the detection task.  
First, it is better to read the paper: (*coming soon*) to understand general framework.

Object detection models (Faster RCNN, Cascade RCNN and RetinaNet) used in this work are built upon [detectron2 API](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)
