### Challenge: https://ead2020.grand-challenge.org/Home/

#### üèÜ Our method ranked [**first**](https://ead2020.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/results/) in the artefact detection task.

First, it is better to read the paper to understand general framework: 

[Endoscopic Artefact Detection with Ensemble of Deep Neural Networks](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2595/endoCV2020_paper_id_10.pdf)

A Docker image with installed PyTorch and Detectron2 environments can be obtained [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/splendor90/detectron2)

Object detection models (Faster RCNN, Cascade RCNN and RetinaNet) used in this work are built upon [Detectron2 API](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

**Ensemble** and **Test Time Augmentation** is adapted from the [Ensemble Methods for Object Detection](https://github.com/ancasag/ensembleObjectDetection)
